## Pet Grooming Service Booking
This website is a real-time booking website for pet grooming services. Users need to fill out the information form on the left and hit the submit button to schedule an appointment. Users can check out, modify, and delete their appointments on the table that is on the right side of the website. To modify an appointment, click on the modify button on the appointment. It will bring the user's appointment back to the form on the left and users need to make sure they have filled out every part of the form to successfully modify their appointments.

For CSS positioning, I mostly used margin-(top/left/right) to line everything up. I also used grid-template-columns to set the size percentage of the left(form area) and right(table area) body of the website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The website is a real-time one-page website that users can immediately see the modification they made to the data on the table by creating, modifying, or deleting.
